Something cool -

Part 1 requires getting every possible 9 you can get from a starting 0. Doesn't matter if there are 1 or 50 paths from that 0 to a single 9, score is still 1.

I accomplish this by making a set, and once a 9 is reached, it is in the set for that starting point and won't be added again.

Part 2 asks for every possible path from the 0 to every single 9. The only change I had to make was change peaks from a set to a list. This solved it! EASY!
I almost spent a really long time trying to figure this out.
